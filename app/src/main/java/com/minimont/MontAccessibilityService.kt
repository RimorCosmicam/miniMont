/**
 * The service that owns a window over Settings, and delivers touches onto the desktop.
 *
 * Two jobs, and neither of them is reading the screen. It never asks for window content: the
 * manifest withholds `canRetrieveWindowContent`, so this cannot see what you are doing even though
 * accessibility services generally can.
 *
 * Pairing needs it because Android's six-digit code lives in its own Settings activity. Opening
 * that puts this app in the background, so a pairing sheet drawn in our own window is a sheet you
 * cannot see at the moment you need it. An accessibility overlay sits above Settings instead.
