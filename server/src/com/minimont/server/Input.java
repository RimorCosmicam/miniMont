/**
 * Reading mode: taps and drags from the tablet, landing on the desktop display.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the client's, which is tap and scroll and nothing else — no drag, no right
 * click, no modifier. That is what the AirMate client sends today, and a host that invented gestures
 * the client cannot produce would be answering a question nobody asked.
 *
 * Unlike the Mac there is no cursor to borrow and put back. A tap here is a finger on that display,
 * which is what the display expects, so nothing has to be restored afterwards.
 *
 * The events go through the `input` command rather than through injected MotionEvents. That costs a
 * process per gesture and is provisional: it is the version that cannot break, while direct
 * injection needs private framework calls that have moved twice in three releases. Video is the
 * milestone this build is for; this is here so the display is not read-only while we get there.
